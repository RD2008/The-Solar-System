# General Information on Space

Space is a dark and mysterious place. No-one has ever travelled far in space because of the limits of our technology. Because of the dangers in space which include solar flares, not many people have gone to space and much research can't be done. This text will be about the solar system and the region of space we live in.

# Our Solar System and where it is in The Galaxy

Our Solar System lies in the Milky Way Galaxy. A galaxy is a huge bunch of stars and planets combined to make solar systems . In the center of a large galaxy there will always be a black hole. Black holes can suck anything inside them! Our Galaxy is a spiral galaxy meaning it has spirals coming out of the center. We live on the edge of the Orion spiral.

# Into the Solar System!

Our Solar System consists of 8 planets, many asteroids and a few dwarf planets, not to forget comets and the Sun! The Sun is the thing that keeps the solar system together using gravity. Gravity is a force that pulls objects together the density that an object has is how much gravity it has. Gravity also keeps the moons of the universe orbiting around their home planets.

# The sun and the 8 planets

The sun is a burning hot ball of chemicals that has many sunspots and every hour, thousands of solar flares burst out of the sun. The gravity of the sun keeps the whole solar system orbiting around it. There are 5 parts to the solar system. The first is the Terrestrial Planets and these have rocky surfaces. Earth is one of these. The third is the Gassy Giants that are huge planets only made of gassy substances. In between the third and the first lies the ring of asteroids called the Asteroid Belt. The asteroid belt has millions and billions of rocky forms known as asteroids. The fourth part is the Kuiper Belt which consists of comets and icy surfaces. Pluto is a dwarf planet near the kuiper belt. The last part is a big cloud of gas that envelopes the solar system called the Oort Cloud(say "ourt").

## The Sun

The Sun is a huge ball of gas that emits heat and we use he sun's ray for solar power. We owe our lives to the sun as without its heat we would never have evolved and without the sun I wouldn't be writing this or you reading this! The Sun started of as a ball of helium and the density and heat made it become a sun. Then it started burning its helium and other gases. As they burn down, they form heavier elements such as iron and copper. After the sun can no longer go on, it collapses. It starts a process where it grows and shrinks and grows and shrinks. When it is big it is known as a Red Giant and when it is small it is known as a Red Dwarf. After this process ends, it finally does a big collapse and the outer layers of the sun explode outwards and it is left with its core which burn bright white and finally reduces to nothing.

# The Terrestrial Planets

The terrestrial planets include Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. These are all rocky planets that have a crust(outside layer), a mantle(middle) and core(center). The terrestrial planets do not get very big and can be hot and cold.

## Mercury

Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and also the smallest. Its temperature varies from -173 degrees celcius to 427. It spins slowly so it has long days. It also doesn't have an atmosphere to trap the heat so on oneside it is boiling and on the other it is freezing.

## Venus

Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system even though it is not the closest to the sun. The reason is because of its atmosphere. Venus, Earth and Mars are in the goldilocks zone.Even though we would've had three earth's, Venus began going through its global warming process very early and its atmosphere stsrted to thicken. Soon it was raving with storms and having acidic rains while volcanoes worsened the situations. No satelite would last on Venus. It reaches 462 degrees!

## Earth

Earth is our home and we owe luck that Earth evolved safely and now we are here. Earth is one of few planets to have life and who knows if there are other Earths out there.

### The Moon

The Moon was formed when a planet crashed into the Earth at a huge speed, practically blowing off its crust. Back then the solar system had hundreds of planets and some got flung into space while others crashed in their paths. After the debree flew off, the debree started circling the Earth and gathered up to form the moon. The moon has many craters from the small asteroids that are constantly crashing into the moon.

## Mars

Mars is another failed planet that could have had life. Mars' atmosphere blew off after a planet crashed into it and the remaining debree formed its two moons.The mars started to freeze as its atmosphere faded. Now mars has the largest mountain in the solar system that was an active volcano once. Mars is our partner in space as scientists think of taking the earths' carbon dioxide and making a better atmosphere on mars so we can have water and life on mars too. Venus cannot be brought back as it is too hot.

# The Asteroid Belt

The asteroid belt is a huge ring of asteroids circling the sun. The main natural bodies in it are the asteroids Ceres , Vesta and Eros.You might be thinking why it's not a planet. Well, the reason is that the solar system's largest planet, Jupiter, has such strong gravity that it essentially pulls it apart each time two asteroids try to combine. Jupiter is the monster of the solar system as it can engulfe everything in its way and that includes Earth as Jupiter is a million times bigger than Earth!

## Ceres

Dwarf planet Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and the only dwarf planet located in the inner solar system. It was the first member of the asteroid belt to be discovered when Giuseppe Piazzi spotted it in 1801. And when Dawn arrived in 2015, Ceres became the first dwarf planet to receive a visit from a spacecraft. Called an asteroid for many years, Ceres is so much bigger and so different from its rocky neighbors that scientists classified it as a dwarf planet in 2006. Even though Ceres comprises 25 percent of the asteroid belt's total mass, tiny Pluto is still 14 times more massive.

## Vesta

Vesta is the second most massive body in the main asteroid belt, accounting for almost nine percent of the total mass of all asteroids. Only dwarf planet Ceres is more massive in that region of rocky debris between Mars and Jupiter. NASA’s Dawn spacecraft circled Vesta from July 16, 2011 until Sept. 5, 2012, when it departed and began its journey to dwarf planet Ceres.The giant asteroid is almost spherical, and so is nearly classified a dwarf planet. Unlike most known asteroids, Vesta has separated into crust, mantle and core (a characteristic known as being differentiated), much like Earth.Understanding why this is so was one of the objectives of the Dawn mission. The answer turned out to be that Vesta formed early, within 1 to 2 million years of the birth of the solar system. Short-lived radioactive material that was incorporated into bodies that formed during this epoch heated them to the point where—in cases like Vesta—the objects melted, allowing the denser materials to sink to the asteroid's core and the lower density materials to rise.Vesta has one of the largest brightness ranges observed on any rocky body in our solar system. The bright materials appear to be native rocks, while the dark material is believed to have been deposited by other asteroids crashing into Vesta. Scientists on the Dawn team estimate that about 300 dark asteroids with diameters ranging from one to 10 km (0.6 to six miles) hit Vesta during the last 3.5 billion years. This would have been enough to wrap the Vesta in a blanket of material about three to seven feet (one to two meters) thick.An extensive system of troughs encircles Vesta's equatorial region. The largest, named Divalia Fossa, is bigger than the Grand Canyon.Vesta appears to be the source of the Howardite, Eucrite and Diogenite groups of meteorites that have been found on Earth. They help scientists understand the "Lunar Cataclysm," when a repositioning of the gas-giant planets billions of years ago destabilized the orbits of asteroids in the early asteroid belt and triggered a solar-system-wide bombardment. They also provide clues to Vesta's geochemical evolution, a story that was tested and enhanced by the information Dawn provided about the asteroid's surface and interior.Vesta is believed to have lost about one percent of its mass less than a billion years ago in a massive collision responsible for the Rheasilvia crater, which is about 310 miles (500 kilometers) wide—some 95 percent of the asteroid's mean diameter. The Vesta family of asteroids is probably debris from this collision. Another huge crater is Veneneia, which is about 250 miles (400 km) in diameter.

## Eros

Eros is famous as the first asteroid to be orbited by a spacecraft, and as the first one on which a spacecraft landed. But it was important to astronomers as far back as 1898, when it became the first near-Earth asteroid (NEA) to be discovered.The NEAR spacecraft first flew by Eros on Dec. 23, 1998 at a distance of about 2,400 miles (about 3,800 kilometers) and found that the asteroid was smaller than expected and had two medium-sized craters, a long surface ridge and a density similar to that of Earth's crust. After several trajectory adjustments, NEAR finally moved into orbit around Eros on Valentine's Day (befitting an asteroid named for the Greek god of love), Feb. 14, 2000.After nearly a year in orbit, during which time the spacecraft was renamed "NEAR Shoemaker" in honor of astrogeology pioneer Eugene Shoemaker, the mission carried out humanity's first asteroid landing on Feb. 12, 2001. Eros was 196 million miles (315 million kilometers) from Earth at the time.The spacecraft wasn't expected to survive the landing but its instruments remained operational, leading to yet another milestone. "This is the first gamma-ray experiment that has ever been done on the surface of a body other than Earth," said Dr. Jacob Trombka of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. "In fact, we can say it's the first feasibility study of how to design an instrument to be used on a rover that could select samples from the surface, look for the presence of water, or map the surface for the purpose of future mining."

# The Gas Giants

There are four planets in our solar system that are collectively known as the “gas giants,” a term coined by the twentieth-century science fiction writer James Blish. There is Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. They are also called “Jovians,” as Jove is the Latin name for Jupiter, the largest of the four. The gas planets are made up almost entirely of gases, primarily hydrogen and helium. While they might have near-solid inner cores of molten heavy metals, they have thick outer layers of liquid and gaseous molecular hydrogen and helium and metallic hydrogen.

## Jupiter

Jupiter's mass is 318 times greater than Earth's. As Jupiter formed, it grew in size by swallowing up its outer satellites. Its differential rotation (an equatorial rotation shorter than the rotation at higher latitudes) is evidence of its liquid, gaseous surface. Jupiter’s magnetic field is 20,000 times stronger than Earth’s and it has the strongest radio emissions of any planet in the solar system. Jupiter is surrounded by a thin ring of dark material and as of April 2011 has 63 known moons in orbit around it, the largest of which are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Calliso.

## Saturn

Saturn has the lowest density of any planet in our solar system. It has a rocky core composed of liquid metallic hydrogen and elements consistent with the primordial solar nebula (gaseous cloud) that formed the solar system. Saturn’s most prominent feature is its rings, first observed by Galileo in 1610. The rings are composed of millions of small particles of rock and ice, each having its own independent orbit around the planet. Although the other gas planets also have rings, it is not yet known why Saturn’s are so prominent.

## Uranus

Uranus is the only gas giant with its equator at a right angle to its orbit. It was also the first planet to be discovered through a telescope. It has 13 known rings that are dark and composed of dust and particles up to 10 meters in diameter. Uranus has 5 large moons as well as 10 smaller ones that were discovered by the Voyager 2 probe. The methane in Uranus’s upper atmosphere is what gives the planet its blue color.

## Neptune

Neptune’s existence was the first to be predicted by mathematical calculations before the planet was actually seen. Neptune's mass is approximately 17 times greater than Earth’s. Its winds can reach up to 2,000 km per hour, the fastest in the solar system. Like Uranus, Neptune appears blue due to the methane in its atmosphere, but Neptune also has vivid blue clouds; it is not known what gives the clouds their color. Like all the other gas giants, Neptune has rings. Prior to images from Voyager 2, these rings were only visible from Earth as faint, dark arcs. Their composition is still unknown. Neptune has 13 known moons, the largest of which is Triton. Triton is the only large moon in the solar system that orbits its planet in the opposite direction of its planet’s rotation.

## The Kuiper Belt

Astronomers think the icy objects of the Kuiper Belt are remnants left over from the formation of the solar system. Similar to the relationship between the main asteroid belt and Jupiter, it's a region of objects that might have come together to form a planet had Neptune not been there. Instead, Neptune's gravity stirred up this region of space so much that the small, icy objects there weren't able to coalesce into a large planet. The amount of material in the Kuiper Belt today might be just a small fraction of what was originally there. According to one well-supported theory, the shifting orbits of the four giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) could have caused most of the original material -- likely 7 to 10 times the mass of Earth -- to be lost. The basic idea is that early in the solar system's history, Uranus and Neptune were forced to orbit farther from the Sun due shifts in the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. As they drifted farther outward, they passed through the dense disk of small, icy bodies left over after the giant planets formed. Neptune's orbit was the farthest out, and its gravity bent the paths of countless icy bodies inward toward the other giants. Jupiter ultimately slingshotted most of these icy bodies either into extremely distant orbits (to form the Oort Cloud) or out of the solar system entirely. As Neptune tossed icy objects sunward, this caused its own orbit to drift even farther out, and its gravitational influence forced remaining icy objects into the range of locations where we find them in the Kuiper Belt.Today the Kuiper Belt is slowly eroding itself away. Objects that remain there occasionally collide, producing smaller objects fragmented by the collision, sometimes comets and also dust that's blown out of the solar system by the solar wind.

The Kuiper Belt represents an enormous, donut-shaped volume of space in the outer solar system. While there are many icy bodies in this region that we broadly refer to as Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) or trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), they're fairly diverse in size, shape and color. And importantly, they're not evenly distributed through space -- once astronomers started discovering them in the early 1990s, one of the early surprises was that KBOs could be grouped according to the shapes and sizes of their orbits. This led scientists to understand that there are several distinct groupings, or populations, of these objects whose orbits provide clues about their history. Which category an object belongs to has a lot to do with how it has interacted with the gravity of Neptune over time.
As mysterious a it is, The Kuiper Belt has many interesting objects such as Pluto, Charon, Eris, Makemake, and Haumea. These are the main objecs in The Kuiper Belt. Long ago these objects were known as planets but new research led them to a baffling thought. They had the characteristics of a planet, yet could not be considered so. So they made a new class of space objects - Dwarf Planets. The objects listed above are now considered Dwarf Planets and have a long history.

# Dwarf Planets - planets like no other

Dwarf planets are what you think they are. They are small rocky body’s that orbit the sun in our solar system. There are 5 officially recognised dwarf planets in the solar system.Dwarf planets are the same as normal planets, just smaller. There are other differences between planets and dwarf planets, with the main one being that dwarf planets have not cleared other objects in the area that they orbit.There should be millions upon millions of dwarf planets similar to the dwarfs outside of the solar system, however we just haven’t found them yet with current technology. We know that there are many extra solar system planets that are normal sized planets that have already been discovered, and we think that there are also endless amounts of these planets orbiting stars in the universe. These extra solar system planets are called ‘Exoplanets’. We will definitely discover millions of dwarf planets and exoplanets in the future.

## Pluto

Pluto was the first Kuiper Belt object to be discovered, in 1930, at a time before astronomers had reason to expect a large population of icy worlds beyond Neptune. Today it's known as the "King of the Kuiper Belt" -- it's the largest object in the region, even though another object similar in size, called Eris, has a slightly higher mass. Pluto’s orbit is said to be in resonance with the orbit of Neptune, meaning Pluto's orbit is in a stable, repeating pattern with Neptune's. For every three orbits completed by Neptune, Pluto makes two orbits. In this situation, Pluto never comes close enough to Neptune to be affected much by its gravity. In fact, even though its orbit crosses Neptune's orbit, Pluto gets physically closer to Uranus than it ever does to Neptune.

### Charon - The moon for a dwarf planet!

Charon was discovered in 1978 when sharp-eyed astronomer James Christy noticed images of Pluto were strangely elongated. The blob seemed to move around Pluto. The direction of elongation cycled back and forth over 6.39 days―Pluto's rotation period. Searching through their archives of Pluto images taken years before, Christy found more cases where Pluto appeared elongated. Additional images confirmed he had discovered the first known moon of Pluto.At half the size of Pluto, Charon is the largest of Pluto's moons and the largest known satellite relative to its parent body. Pluto-Charon is our solar system's only known double planetary system. The same surfaces of Charon and Pluto always face each other, a phenomenon called mutual tidal locking. Charon orbits Pluto every 6.4 Earth days.Charon is almost half the size of Pluto. The little moon is so big that Pluto and Charon are sometimes referred to as a double dwarf planet system. The distance between them is 19,640 km (12,200 miles).The Hubble Space Telescope photographed Pluto and Charon in 1994 when Pluto was about 30 AU from Earth. These photos showed that Charon is more neutral grey than Pluto (which has a red tinge), indicating that they have different surface compositions and structure.Charon's orbit around Pluto takes 6.4 Earth days, and one Pluto rotation (a Pluto day) takes 6.4 Earth days. Charon neither rises nor sets, but hovers over the same spot on Pluto's surface, and the same side of Charon always faces Pluto―this is called tidal locking. Compared with most of the planets and moons, the Pluto-Charon system is tipped on its side, like Uranus. Pluto's rotation is retrograde: it rotates backwards, from east to west (Uranus and Venus also have retrograde rotations).

## Eris

Eris is one of the largest known dwarf planets in our solar system. It's about the same size as Pluto, but is three times farther from the Sun. Eris first appeared to be larger than Pluto. This triggered a debate in the scientific community that led to the International Astronomical Union's decision in 2006 to clarify the definition of a planet. Pluto, Eris and other similar objects are now classified as dwarf planets. Originally designated 2003 UB313 (and nicknamed for the television warrior Xena by its discovery team), Eris is named for the ancient Greek goddess of discord and strife. The name fits since Eris remains at the center of a scientific debate about the definition of a planetEris was discovered on Oct. 21, 2003 by M.E. Brown, C.A. Trujillo, and D. Rabinowitz at the Palomar Observatory.With a radius of about 722 miles (1,163 kilometers), Eris is about 1/5 the radius of Earth. Eris, like Pluto, is a little smaller than Earth's Moon. If the Earth were the size of a nickel, Eris would be about as big as a popcorn kernel. From an average distance of 6,289,000,000 miles (10,125,000,000 kilometers), Eris is about 68 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 5 hours and 15 minutes to travel from the Sun to Eris.Eris takes 557 Earth years to make one trip around the Sun. The plane of Eris' orbit is well out of the plane of the solar system's planets and extends far beyond the Kuiper Belt, a zone of icy debris beyond the orbit of Neptune.As Eris orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 25.9 hours, making its day length similar to ours. Dwarf planet Eris is a member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt. This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds, which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids.

## Makemake

Along with fellow dwarf planets Pluto, Eris and Haumea, Makemake is located in the Kuiper Belt, a region outside the orbit of Neptune. Slightly smaller than Pluto, Makemake is the second-brightest object in the Kuiper Belt as seen from Earth (while Pluto is the brightest). It takes about 305 Earth years for this dwarf planet to make one trip around the sun.Makemake holds an important place in the history of solar system studies because it—along with Eris—was one of the objects whose discovery prompted the International Astronomical Union to reconsider the definition of a planet and to create the new group of dwarf planets. Makemake was named after the Rapanui god of fertility. Makemake was discovered Mar. 31, 2005 by M.E. Brown, C.A. Trujillo, and D. Rabinowitz at the Palomar Observatory. With a radius of approximately 444 miles (715 kilometers), Makemake is 1/9 the radius of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Makemake would be about as big as a mustard seed.From an average distance of 4,253,000,000 miles (6,847,000,000 kilometers), Makemake is 45.8 astronomical units away from the sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 6 hours and 20 minutes to travel from the sun to Makemake. Makemake takes 305 Earth years to make one trip around the sun. As Makemake orbits the sun, it completes one rotation every 22.5 hours, making its day length similar to ours. Dwarf planet Makemake is a member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt. This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds, which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids.

## Haumea

Originally designated 2003 EL61 (and nicknamed Santa by one discovery team), Haumea resides in the Kuiper belt and is roughly the same size as Pluto. Haumea is one of the fastest rotating large objects in our solar system. Its fast spin distorts Haumea's shape, making this dwarf planet look like a football.Two teams claim credit for discovering of Haumea citing evidence from observations made in 2003 and 2004. The International Astronomical Union’s Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature lists the discovery location as Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain on Mar. 7, 2003, but no official discoverer is listed.Haumea was named after the Hawaiian goddess of fertility.With a radius of about 385 miles (620 kilometers), Haumea is about 1/14 the radius of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Haumea would be about as big as a sesame seed.From an average distance of 4,010,000,000 miles (6,452,000,000 kilometers), Haumea is 43 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 6 hours to travel from the Sun to Haumea.Haumea takes 285 Earth years to make one trip around the Sun. As Haumea orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 4 hours, making it one of the fastest rotating large objects in our solar system. It is possible a massive impact billions of years ago set off Haumea's spin and created its moons. Dwarf planet Haumea is a member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt. This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids.
